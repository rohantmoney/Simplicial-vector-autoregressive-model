# Simplicial_vector_autoregressive_model
In this study, we address the scalability challenge of the vector autoregressive (VAR) model in modeling dynamic processes with numerous time series by leveraging data relations as inductive priors. We propose two simplicial VAR models: one for modeling time series on a single simplicial level (e.g., edge flows) and another for jointly modeling multiple time series across different levels, capturing their spatio-temporal interdependencies. These models employ simplicial convolutional filters to effectively capture structure-aware dependencies in a multiresolution manner.  Through experiments on synthetic and real-world networks, including water distribution networks and collaborative agent scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive signal modeling accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

The experiment utilizes real dataset from https://datasets.simula.no/alfheim/, containing time-varying positional data of football players. This data is utilized to construct a simplicial complex (SC), where the average position of players is calculated, and the SC is constructed based on the distances between these average positions.In this experiment, the vertex signal represents speed, the edge signal corresponds to distance, and the triangle signal signifies area.
